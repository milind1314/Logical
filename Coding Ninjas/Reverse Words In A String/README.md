# Reverse Words in String

This project solves the problem of reversing the words in a given string while ensuring that:

- There is exactly one space between words.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.
- Multiple spaces between words or around the string are removed.

## Problem Description

You are given a string `str` of length `N`. Your task is to reverse the original string word by word. There can be multiple spaces between two words, and there can be leading or trailing spaces. The output reversed string should contain a single space between words and should not have leading or trailing spaces.

### Input:
- A string `str` with length `N` (0 <= N <= 10^5).

### Output:
- A new string where the words are reversed with exactly one space between them and no leading or trailing spaces.

### Constraints:
- Time limit: 1 second.
- Memory limit: 256 MB.

### Example 1:
